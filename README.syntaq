= Syntaq

Syntaq is a lightweight markup-to-HTML converter. The markup format used is
a superset of Creole, including a few custom extensions.

== Usage

From within Python:
``` python
from syntaq import Markup
print(Markup("hello, **world**").to_html())
```

== Inline Markup

=== Emphasis
Emphasis is attained via double forward slashes. Syntaq converts these to <em>
tags, e.g. ``"this is ~//really~// exciting"`` becomes ``"this is
<em>really</em> exciting"``.

== Block Markup
